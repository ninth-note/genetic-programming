# The Assignment 1 first-part folder contains:
    --> gp_funcs.py file, which holds a class that allows one to use genetic programming functions to setup an evolution
    --> the part_1.py file, which uses the functions from the above class and completes each of the 4 parts using the required functions

# Note: --> run:
    >> python part_1.py (to see the first part of the assignment run and view the plots for each of the four parts (i - iv))
