# The Second Part of assignment 2, where we apply gp practices to a real problem

[excel files]:

--> Two files that hold the supervisor student capacities (how much they can take on) and students file that holds the students ranking of each lecturer.


[part_2.py]:

--> The actual genetic algorithm to find best solution (assign each lecturer to student while taking into account each students preferences)

[verify_results.py]:

This file will test the best solution outputted from the part_2.py genetic program that assigns supervisors to students taking into account how much the students want to work with each lecturer. It will test for capacity overflow and neatly print results for easier visual interpretation of results (rather than just a dictionary that is hard to read)

(take best solution (the outputted dictionary) and slot it into main in the data variable, and then just run)
